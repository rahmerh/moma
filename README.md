**Moma** is a Linux-first, CLI **mo**d **ma**nager.

Moma automates everything you need to start modding your games on Linux. It takes care of downloading mods, setting up tools, and managing your configuration in a simple, declarative format, so your mod setup stays clean, trackable, and easy to reproduce.

To keep your game installation untouched, Moma builds a temporary environment where mods are layered only when you launch the game. Your base files remain unchanged, and mods donâ€™t need to be installed directly into the game folder.

Moma avoids Windows-native mod management tools and fully embraces native Linux features. It's designed for minimal, terminal-driven modding without sacrificing control or flexibility.

## Installation

Make sure you have Rust installed first. Then clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rahmerh/moma.git
cd moma
```

If you want the latest, stable binary check out main first:

```
git checkout main

```

If you want latest (and potentially broken), stay on develop.

Run the following to install the binary system-wide:
```
sudo make install
```

This will copy the binary to `/usr/local/bin/moma`. You can now run moma from anywhere.

> ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** You can also install it locally without sudo:
>
> ```sh
> mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
> cp target/release/moma ~/.local/bin
> ```
> Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`.

## Support

Moma only supports certain game platforms and games (and game versions). This is mostly due to that I'm not going to buy games I won't play, so I can't reliably add support for it. If you want a game that isn't on the list, feel free to add an issue to request support. I'd be happy to help.

### Supported game platforms

- Steam (Proton or native)

### Supported games

- Skyrim SE/AE (SKSE modded)

## Usage

### Initialize
```sh
moma init
```

Starts the game setup wizard, guiding you through configuration, paths, and required tools.

### Launch a game
```sh
sudo moma launch <game>
```

Launches the game with mods layered in via an overlay. Requires root privileges due to mounting.

## Configuration

Moma stores configuration in a single TOML file, at `~/.config/moma/config.toml`.

When you run `moma init`, it creates the file for you. You can also edit it manually to adjust paths, Proton versions, or game settings.

See `docs/config.md` for all options.

## Roadmap

### Done
[x] Initial proof-of-concept in Rust: folder structure, mount logic, and game launch support (Skyrim)

### In progress
Installation guide (Makefile + instructions)

### Planned
1. Mod installation and removal
2. (Unit) tests
3. Nexus mods API integration
4. Load order management
5. Declarative mod installation
6. NXS link handler (Nexus-style download URLs)
7. FOMOD CLI wizard
8. Logging for debug purposes
9. Proper usage- and in depth documentation
